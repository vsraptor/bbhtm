    "Before we start with the meat of the matter let's explore somewhat the basic differences between the traditional approach and HTM.\n",
    "Traditional NN use as a basic building block artificial-neuron called **Perceptron**, which has almost nothing to do with the real neuron, but is just superficially similar. It will be more correct to call it *linear classifier* instead.\n",
    "In addition the output signal of this classifier is modified by a non-linear function, so that it can change within specific boundaries or to limit the behavior in some way.\n",
    "Here is schematic of the percepton :\n",
    "\n",
    "![perceptron](imgs/perceptron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron works by multiplying the input signal by the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ out = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n  w_i * x_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to learn to classify data is to adjust the weights in such a way so as to predict correctly provided pairs of input and output data.\n",
    "Next those pseudo neurons are paired in a layer, when multiple layers are connected together you build a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![nn](imgs/nn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the normal procedure is to train the NN with labeled data in a similar fashion that we do single Perceptron (this is the general approach, there is also unsupervised variants).\n",
    "You pass data on the input and then propagate the signal through, doing the necessary calculation in-between.\n",
    "Once the result is out (prediction) we compare it with correct output (i.e. the labeled data).\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be almost certainly a differences between predicted and labeled output, so we take this difference and propagate it backwards adjusting the weights and biases by a small amount so that next time when we do forward pass the prediction differ less and less.\n",
    "After that we pick another data-item or batch-of-data ... rinse and repeat, until we get pretty close to the original labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this we have well-tuned network that can classify correctly data similar to the one we trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of going backward trough the network is called **Backward propagation** and the slight adjustment made on the way is called **Stochastic Gradient Descent** (*there are variation on those too*).\n",
    "This simplified model suffer from a \"small\" problem which did not allow NN to be used widely up until ~10 years ago. (NN were first introduced in the dawn of AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is called *\"the vanishing gradient problem\"* and happens when we chain many layers together. Because different layers learn with different speeds it happen that layers close to the output learn alot faster, but layers at the beginning are stuck and learn almost nothing (the adjustments are smaller and smaller the deeper the network), so that NN can not be used to solve problems above specific \"complexity\", no matter how many new layers we add.\n",
    "So adding more layers only increases the computation time without improving the prediction capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is need for more layers so that we can represent richer models and find deeper patterns in the data.\n",
    "The so called \"deep networks\" solved this problem by adding bottleneck (more or less) at some point inside the NN thus forcing the multi-layered network to act as multiple multi-layered networks.\n",
    "Further the NN proliferated even more by replacing the building block i.e. the Perceptron with more complex mathematical abstractions.\n",

Of course you can create multiple TM's and then do multiple step by combining the results, but I will leave this as exercises for the reader.\n",
    "Anyway this approach would be expensive, that is what Hierarchical part of the theory is. Once we have it :)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Don't confuse also variable-order memory, which means that you take into account all possible contexts that happened in the past for the current one n-step prediction. \n",

    "**Second step** We have to figure out which cells should become active. For this we need the current input data and the cells which are in predictive state.\n",
    "The input-data will tell us which columns should become active. For every column as we said in the overview we will check if there is predicted cell, then we will activate it. If there is no predicted cell then we will activate all cells in the column.\n",
    "In this *selection* process we look at the Data as 1D array which describes the columns of the Active state 2D array. Predicted state is also 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Third step** If the learning mode is ON, then we have to update somehow the connection-matrix. \n",
    "We have all the information we need. Present active cells are stored in *Active* 1D-bitmap and the previous active cells are stored in the *Past* 1D-bitmap. Prediction is Past =to=> Active, which means row indexes of the Connection matrix (time t) would be set only if the bit at this position in the Active state is 1 and the row-content (SDR) would be set by the Past state (time t-1). \n",
    "\n",
    "So we do a **union** for every row for which the Active 1D-bitmap cell has value of 1 (row).\n",
    "Because both bitmaps are Sparse only very small percent of the rows will be unionized with the past 1D-bitmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how both abstraction for the Connection matrix work .... on the level of connection between two cells as **adj_matrix[i,j]** and on the level of cells at position active_idxs as distal-dendrites **`adj_matrix[active_idxs,:] |= past`**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here I will lay out my theory it is mostly intuition, but I think it is correct. Some more mathy guy can prove me wrong ;) or most probably right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the union property of SDR, it is robust, but still after may be hundred of random writes it will fill up and will start to give **false positives**. From what I was able to test so far this does not happen. Why ?\n",
    "The reason is three fold, first we are not using single SDR, but in the case of 5x2000 region, we have 10_000 to  spare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second reason is that the memory is **self-selective**, what do I mean by that ? new \"past-state\" is stored only in 2% of the rows, on top of that if there is repeated transition-pattern in the signal it will be saved in approximately the same rows i.e. we are in fact changing the memory very little.\n",
    "You can think of it as storing \"transition-patterns\", rather than random data i.e. the data seeks its destination automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this **self-selective** behavior is profound observation. \n",
    "I mentioned that HTM is Memorization not Computation and now you can clearly see the power, the way we are storing patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third in 5x2000 region a connection row is 10_000 bits not 2000, so the sparseness is not 2% but 0.4% which makes union property even more robust.\n",
    "(This is why in my tests even 5x300 regions seems to behave well. In fact I think they behave better.).\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to use the following abstraction : storing the same image on a file system will occupy new file every time we try to save it or we have to scan all the files pixel by pixel to decide do we have it already (in the pure case, where file names don't tell us anything), that is how computer memory works in its basic form.\n",
    "But in the case of the brain in a sense the image itself is both the storage space and the search algorithm, it occupies automatically the same space. if we get similar image it will again seamlessly blend with what is already stored.\n",
    "I hope you can imagine what I just described :), it is like a hologram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we have the option at some point to start turning some bits off when the memory start to fill up i.e. implementing some sort of \"forgetting\" mechanism.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "There is much more to be done and especially tested. \n",
    "Those are the initial breakthroughs of the HTM theory, the most important and hardest part how to build hierarchies of HTM-regions is still ahead, but what we have is promising.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think you now appreciate the difference between HTM and NN.\n",
    "Not from the standpoint of one is better, but the difference in approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "*One of your disappointments could be* that TM predict only single step, but this is by design.\n",
    "For long term predictions I've seen Numenta videos they use separate Classifier which wraps around TM and keep tracks and probabilities of the \"transitions\", so that it can make multi-step predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other approach is to run multiple TM's and splice the results (I will at some point add the capability to predict nth step, it will be simple parameter when creating TM object).\n",
    "\n",
    "The third option is using TM.forward() method (TM feeds itself, look at the code), which of course very quickly goes out of whack, but may be you can average multiple forward() prediction and it may work!! doubt it, but give it a try.\n",
    "Of course the real way to do it is to build TM hierarchies, which we don't have yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the benefits of this implementation :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is all binary, zeros and ones\n",
    "2. The bulk of the algorithm are simple operations : OR, AND, count-bits, 1D <=> 2D view\n",
    "3. Not much parameters to tune\n",
    "4. Very friendly to optimizations, both in software (C,C++) and hardware (new type of memories, video cards). I can't stress this enough hardware acceleration will be a blast :).\n",
    "5. Have found it to work satisfactory on test data-sets with small region sizes : 5x300, because connection matrix row (SDR-union) is 1500 bits\n",
    "6. Very light on resources compared to full-blown implementation, so I expect it will be cheaper to build hierarchies.\n",
    "7. Easy to parallelize, I think you can literally change every bit asynchronously and it will still work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the disadvantages :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If I missed something obvious it may be wrong !!! doubt it, but you never know :)\n",
    "My biggest concern is if I messed up the sequence of the steps when coding, which may invalidate the results, even that I replied them many time in my mind.\n",
    "2. Not good to research HTM theory details, but this is an abstraction anyway.\n",
    "3. Anything I have not thought about ?\n",
    "4. Have not seen a performance library for doing Fast bit arrays that is tailored to the specific CPU ?!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole package is self-contained and will be easy to integrate in other projects.\n",
    "I have not played with interaction between multiple TM's yet, because I'm still exploring the theory and there are many unimplemented parts of the system (more Encoders, SP, TP, multi-step/thats easy/).\n",
    "I did my best for the limited time I had to test as much behaviors as I can, but there are so much variations, so I hope you will enjoy finding corner cases where current setup does not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome any feedback, like where in the theory I got it wrong for example.\n",
    "I will be grateful if somebody can compare the performance against NuPic or other approaches like NN, Arima ...etc."
